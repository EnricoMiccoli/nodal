# OPMODEL example: non-inverting amplifier
# gain is 2, input is 1V set by v1
# expected output for ideal circuit is e(2) = 2

# Opamp:
#   feedback resistance:    1 ohm
#   output terminal:        node 2
#   ground reference:       node g
#   non-inverting terminal: node 3
#   inverting terminal:     node 1
#
# Notice that we don't need to specify a stand-alone component for the
# feedback loop: setting the feedback resistance to a non zero value
# is sufficient and the resistor will be added internally.

# Additional resistor to set gain
# The amplifier has gain 1 + rf/r1, where rf is the feedback resistance
