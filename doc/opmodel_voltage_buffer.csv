# OPMODEL example: voltage buffer
# output e(2) will be equal to input set by v1
# expected output for ideal circuit is e(2) = 1

# Opamp:
#   feedback resistance:    0 ohm
#   output terminal:        node 2
#   ground reference:       node g
#   non-inverting terminal: node 3
#   inverting terminal:     node 2
#
# To have direct feedback without a resistor, we set the feedback resistance
# to 0 ohm, then we connect the inverting and output terminals to the same
# node (in this case to node 2).
