# Nodal.py
Nodal.py is a simple electrical circuit simulator that uses nodal analysis to solve linear networks made up of resistors and ideal current or voltage sources, both independent and controlled. The numerical work is done by the [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) package.

## Installation
To get the stable release [download it](https://github.com/EnricoMiccoli/nodal/releases/latest) and run
```
$ pip install nodal-1.0.0.whl
```

To try out the latest developments use [`flit`](https://github.com/takluyver/flit) instead:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/EnricoMiccoli/nodal.git
$ cd nodal
$ flit install
```

## Usage example
Suppose we wanted to solve this circuit:

![Circuit diagram](doc/simple.png)

First we would prepare a file describing the circuit. Each line represents a component, using the format    
`name, type, value, first lead, second lead`.

Input file `netlist.csv`:
```
a1,A,1,1,3
r2,R,1,2,3
r3,R,1,1,2
```

Take notice of the orientation of the current generator: current flows toward the node connected to the first lead. Component type can either be
* `A` for current generators
* `R` for resistors

Default units are ampere and ohm.

We can then execute `$ nodal-solver netlist.csv` to get the list of node potentials (unit is volt).

Printed output:
```
Ground node: 2
e(1)    = 1.0
e(3)    = -1.0
```

## A more advanced example

![Circuit diagram](doc/1.6.1.png)

_Example circuit from: [Esercizi da temi d'esame di Elettrotecnica](http://home.deib.polimi.it/damore/download/temiDEsame.pdf)_

Input file `1.6.1.csv`:
```
r1,R,2,1,4
r2,R,2,1,g
r3,R,0.5,1,2
e1,E,8,4,g
a1,A,4,1,2
d1,CCCS,2,2,g,1,g,r2
```

Output:
```
Ground node: g
e(1)    = 2.0
e(2)    = -1.0
e(4)    = 8.0
i(d1)   = -2.0
i(e1)   = 3.0
```

CCCS | CCCS | gain (adimensional) | + current | ground | + driving current | - driving current | component determining the current |
CCVS | CCVS | gain (ohm) | + tension | ground | + driving current | - driving current | component determining the current |
VCCS | VCCS | gain (ohm^-1) | + current | ground | + driving voltage | - driving voltage | NA |
VCVS | VCVS | gain (adimensional) | + voltage | ground | + driving voltage | - driving voltage | NA |

## Modeling operational amplifiers
Opamps are not supported directly, but we can use an equivalent circuit. For example we can simulate a voltage buffer:

Output:
```
Ground node: g
e(1)    = 9.999900000999991
e(2)    = 9.999900000635535
e(3)    = 9.999999999999998
i(d1)   = -3.2741537359603055e-11
i(vs)   = 9.999900000878983e-12
